# ðŸ“Š Bank Customer Churn Prediction (ML Web App)

ðŸ”— [Live Demo on Streamlit Cloud](https://bank-customer-churn-prediction-ntkv6yrvgjsuibraonv8ub.streamlit.app/)

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn. The app is built using **Streamlit** and powered by a **Random Forest classifier** trained on customer data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload a CSV file containing customer data
- Predict churn using a trained ML model
- View predictions in a simple web interface
- Reusable `.pkl` model for fast inference
- Organized project structure with dataset included

##  Model Overview

I trained multiple classification models including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest âœ…

**Random Forest** gave the best performance:
- Accuracy: **85%**
- Precision: **83%**
- Recall: **81%**

So it was selected for final deployment.
